Hello!

This is a basic code for performing Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis using Type Ia supernova data from the DES 5-Year Release, available at https://github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR.

The analysis includes a machine learning application using linear regression implemented with Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn library. The MCMC sampling is performed using the emcee package.

Finally, the cosmological model used in the code is a basic Lambda-CDM model without radiation.
